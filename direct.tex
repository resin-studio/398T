    \begin{itemize}
    \item We need to prove a proposition of form $P \longrightarrow Q$.
    \item To do that we assume $P$ and use rules of inference and other relevant facts to show $Q$.
    \item Let's look at an example.
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{prop}
      If $n$ is even, then $n^2$ is also even.
    \end{prop}
    \begin{proof}
      Assume $n = 2k$ for some number $k$, i.e. $n$ is even. Then $n^2 = (2k)^2 = 4 k^2 = 2 \cdot 2k^2$. This proves $n^2$ is also even.
    \end{proof}

   \begin{prop}
      If $n$ is a natural number, prove that $n^2$ is either divisible by $3$ or leaves a remainder of $1$ when divided by $3$.
    \end{prop}
   
     \begin{prop}
      If $p$ is a prime number greater than $3$, prove that $p$ leaves a remainder of $1$ or $5$ when divided by $6$.
